# Mysterious Organism

## Introduction
The Mysterious Organism project explores a newly discovered organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), found at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. P. aequor is intriguing due to its unique characteristics, including its small DNA size of 15 bases and its ability to mutate rapidly in response to its environment.

This project aims to simulate and study the DNA of P. aequor by creating objects representing the organism using JavaScript.

## Features
- **pAequorFactory**: Factory function to create P. aequor objects with unique specimen numbers and DNA sequences.
- **Mutation Simulation**: Method to simulate mutations in P. aequor DNA, reflecting its high rate of mutation.
- **DNA Comparison**: Method to compare the DNA sequences of different P. aequor objects and calculate the percentage of DNA in common.
- **Survival Likelihood Assessment**: Method to determine the likelihood of P. aequor survival based on its DNA composition.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Mysterious Organism project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository_URL>
   ```

2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

3. Explore the `main.js` file to understand the implementation of the P. aequor simulation.

4. Run the JavaScript code using Node.js to observe the behavior of the simulated P. aequor organisms.

## Usage
The project provides various functionalities to interact with the simulated P. aequor organisms:
- Create new P. aequor objects using the `pAequorFactory` function.
- Simulate mutations in the DNA of P. aequor objects using the `mutate` method.
- Compare the DNA sequences of different P. aequor objects using the `compareDNA` method.
- Assess the likelihood of survival for P. aequor objects using the `willLikelySurvive` method.
